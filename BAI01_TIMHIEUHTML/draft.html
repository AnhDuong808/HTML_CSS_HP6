    <h1>Foreign Affairs (1805–1809)</h1>
    <h2>Attempted annexation of Florida</h2>
    <p>In the aftermath of the <span class="wiki">Louisiana Purchase</span>, Jefferson attempted to annex <span class="wiki">West Florida</span> from Spain, a nation under the control of Emperor <span class="wiki"> Napoleon</span> and the <span class="wiki">French Empire</span> after 1804. In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations.[243][244] A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two million dollar expenditure to purchase Florida. Representative and floor leader <span class="wiki">John Randolph</span>, however, opposed annexation and was upset over Jefferson's secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would land in the <span class="wiki">coffers</span> of Napoleon.[245][244] The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with <span class="wiki">Barnabas Bidwell</span> as floor leader.[245][244] This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress. Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806. Six weeks later the law was made public. The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States. France, however, was in no mood to allow Spain to give up Florida and refused the offer. Florida remained under the control of Spain.[246][244] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters.</p>

    <p>The British conducted seizures of American shipping to search for British deserters from 1806 to 1807; American citizens were thus impressed into the British naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and <span class="wiki">William Pinkney</span> to negotiate with Great Britain to end the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations. The <span class="wiki">Monroe–Pinkney Treaty</span> was finalized but lacked any provisions to end the British policies, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.</p>
    <p>The British ship <span class="wiki"> HMS Leopard</span> fired upon the <span class="wiki">USS Chesapeake</span> off the Virginia coast in June 1807, and Jefferson prepared for war.[249] He issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U.S. waters. He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, "The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]". The <span class="wiki">USS Revenge</span> was dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government; it also was fired upon. Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.</p>
